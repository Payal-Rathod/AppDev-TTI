# HomeBudget Application

This app was created to manage a user's budget and keep track of their expenses.

It is not always easy for someone to know if they are going overbudget, how much money they have left and what type of expenses are more frequent. This app helps the user keep track of all of this which can help them manage their expenses.

This application allows the user to create or load a budget file and add expenses to the budget list by describing its category, description, date and amount. The app keeps track of the balance the user has to allow them to know if they are going over budget. You can also filter through your expenses and see charts that show what type of expenses you have made in a visual way.
